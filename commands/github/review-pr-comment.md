## Important Notes
- Do not add a comment in the issue or PR.
- Use gh to retrieve the comment, do not try a REST or MCP call.
- Do not push, only commit
- Think hard about the recommendations when you evaluate whether to implement them or not as some may seem out of scope but are an actual improvement worth making.

Inventory and present status and recommendation for all items identified in $1 including any changes to code in the branch, repo, or pr including native code changes that you recommend. Prompt the user for which ones to implement with your recommendation.
